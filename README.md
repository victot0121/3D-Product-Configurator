# 3D Product Configurator

This is a 3D Product Configurator built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **TypeScript**. The project allows users to interactively customize a 3D model in real-time by modifying its color, size, and texture. The application uses **React Three Fiber** for rendering the 3D model and **React Spring** for animations.

## Features

- **3D Model Customization**: Change the model's color, size, and texture dynamically.
- **Interactive UI**: Use form elements to update the 3D model in real-time.
- **Smooth Animations**: Experience smooth transitions and animations with React Spring.
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for customization options.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A 3D graphics library for rendering models in the browser.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, making it easy to build 3D scenes.
- **React Spring**: A spring-physics-based animation library for React.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript to improve code quality and readability.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm**: npm is installed with Node.js by default. You can verify the installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-product-configurator.git
   cd 3d-product-configurator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app in action.

## Usage

The application consists of two main components:

1. **CustomizationForm**: A form that allows users to select the color, size, and texture of the product.
2. **Scene**: The 3D scene that displays the model with the selected customization options.

### Customization Options:

- **Color**: Pick a color using the color picker.
- **Size**: Choose between "Small", "Medium", and "Large".
- **Texture**: Choose between "Smooth", "Rough", and "Matte".

As users make changes to the customization options, the 3D model updates accordingly in real-time.

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ CustomizationForm.tsx    # Form for selecting customization options
â”œâ”€â”€ Scene.tsx                # 3D scene displaying the model
â”œâ”€â”€ CustomizationContext.tsx # Context API to manage customization state
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx                  # Main application component
```
