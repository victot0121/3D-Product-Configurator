# 3D Product Configurator

This is a 3D Product Configurator built with **React**, **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **TypeScript**. The project allows users to interactively customize a 3D model in real-time by modifying its color, size, and texture. The application uses **React Spring** for smooth animations and **Context API** for centralized state management.

## Features

- **3D Model Customization**: Change the model's color, size, and texture dynamically.
- **Interactive UI**: Use form elements to update the 3D model in real-time.
- **Smooth Animations**: Experience smooth transitions and animations with React Spring.
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for customization options.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A 3D graphics library for rendering models in the browser.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, making it easy to build 3D scenes.
- **React Spring**: A spring-physics-based animation library for React.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript to improve code quality and readability.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm**: npm is installed with Node.js by default. You can verify the installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- **git**: Make sure git is installed for version control and cloning the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-product-configurator.git
   cd 3d-product-configurator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app in action.

## Usage

### Customization Form

The **CustomizationForm** component allows users to modify the color, size, and texture of the 3D model:

- **Color**: Pick a color using the color picker.
- **Size**: Choose between "Small", "Medium", and "Large".
- **Texture**: Choose between "Smooth", "Rough", and "Matte".

When the user selects an option, the 3D model updates in real-time.

### 3D Model

The **Scene** component renders the 3D model and applies the selected customization options. The model reacts to changes in the form inputs, such as size, color, and texture. React Spring is used to animate these changes smoothly.

### Context API

The **CustomizationContext** is used to manage the global state of the selected customization options. This context allows different parts of the application to access and update the customization data without prop drilling.

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CustomizationForm.tsx    # Form for selecting customization options
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Model.tsx                # 3D model rendering using Three.js and React Three Fiber
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Scene.tsx                # 3D scene displaying the model with dynamic customization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CustomizationContext.tsx # Context API to manage customization state
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                      # Main application component
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx                    # Entry point for the app
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/                      # Folder for styles (if applicable)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css               # Global styles
â””â”€â”€ assets/                      # Folder for 3D models and other assets
    â””â”€â”€ model.glb                # 3D model (GLTF format)
```

## Key Components

### 1. **CustomizationForm.tsx**

This component contains a form where users can select the model's color, size, and texture. The selected options are passed to the parent component via the `onSubmit` prop, which updates the model.

### 2. **Scene.tsx**

The scene renders the 3D model using **React Three Fiber**. It listens to the customization context and updates the model in real-time. The size of the model is scaled based on the user's selection, and the color is dynamically changed.

### 3. **CustomizationContext.tsx**

This file contains the Context API setup for managing the customization state globally. It provides `useCustomization` hook for consuming and updating the customization options.

### 4. **App.tsx**

The root component that combines the customization form and the 3D model scene. It also wraps the app in the `CustomizationProvider` to provide global state management.
